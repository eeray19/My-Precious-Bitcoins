# To DO:

- [x] The algorithm you designed to solve the problem, the choices of the data structures you used and your reasoning.
- [ ] In addition to your actual code, write a pseudo code for your algorithm
- [ ] Compare it with another algorithmic approaches
- [ ] The time complexity of your algorithm (and the space complexity if applicable)
- [ ] Prove that your algorithms gives correct results
- [ ] Further improvements that can be done as future works.


TO DO List:
  Take an integer input "n" for representing the sum of x, y and z.
  Keep a counter integer for counting the number of candidates.
  Come up with a method to find optimal combinations of x, y and z.
  Print line by line the combinations of x, y and z converted as strings splitted with spaces.
