The reasoning why we selected this algorithm is to get more efficient time and the algorithm is useful to range the xâ€™s and for y by splitting the range of n in two and
then concatenating them with the reversed way. Then we used data structures that called Storing data and Ordering and Sorting with that we gain more efficient time for 
Big-O our reasons for this data structures are used for efficient data persistence, such as specifying the collection of attributes and corresponding structures used to 
stores to keep track of the numbers that has been used for x, y, and z. Finally, we used ordering it is provided to our algorithm an efficient method of 
sorting, such as integers used as values.
